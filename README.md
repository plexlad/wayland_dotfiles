# nixdeck dotfiles
My personal configuration for Nixos using the Hyprland window manager. The plan is for these to eventually be my default dotfiles, but need to move services over and make sure they work properly. I absolutely love NixOS!

### To use, install stow on nixos and run `dot_install.sh` to configure dotfiles for nixos
